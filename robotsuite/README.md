### 
- The repo that you might want to use is `new-dev` (but don't push on it because I am working on it)
- Load a robot model:
```python scripts/test_model.py --model robosuite/models/assets/robots/ur5e/soft_robot_square.xml```
- For the springs, search for `tendon` keywords in the xml file
- Getting the gripper back and works w/ the control might be a bit more involved, let me know if you need help
